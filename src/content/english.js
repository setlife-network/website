In seven weeks, I learned more about backend development and product management than I would have learned in an entire semester in college. The projects were quite challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. The high level of autonomy and personal responsibility provided a strong sense of ownership for my work, which I found crucial to my growth and success. I would recommend this program to anyone looking to level up their professional skills in a fun an engaging learning environment.',

# Gathering and Verifying Digital Information
Defend yourself against fake news and extraordinary claims!

## Course Outline
### 1. Intro to Information Theory

  - What are the different components of a piece of information?
  - Where it came from? (the source)
  - What does it look like? (the form)
  - Why do we need information? How do we use it to defend our sense of truth?

### 2. Applied Research Tools and Practices

  - Offering this early on for the quick and dirty. Dive deeper into digital verification after this chapter.
  - Optimizing Google Searches with specific time frames

#### Optimizing Google Searches

  To use Google's search engine as a resource for fathering information, you enter a string of words and numbers into the search box. The results that appear are determined by an algorithm that has been continually maintained, developed, and secured for years. Generally the algorithm makes an assessment on the link for each result and bases it on things like:
  -- Number of visits to the website
  -- How long it's been since anyone had first visited the website
  -- How many other websites that already exist on the Internet link to and from the result


  Using Google search results to determine what was understood

  As human developers continue to work on the algorithm, it advances and grows in complexity. Filtering the first page of results to within a time-frame builds context (provide examples)

### 3. Evaluating Sources

  - There is a person, or at least the influence of a person behind everything. Bots and algorithms were programmed by people. Machine learning algorithms use backpropagation which usually requires a person to provide a known value to learn against
  - Keep track of the credibility of your sources for your own convenience, but remain vigilant because everyone makes mistakes. Reputation matters, but not as much as cost analysis.
  - Practice resource cost evaluation. Try to determine the logistics required to actually obtain evidence to support a claim. For example, a journalist reports that a new species of whale has been discovered near the bottom of the ocean. Here are some questions you could challenge yourself or others to answer:
    - What evidence exists support this claim?
    - Has the journalist obtained sound recordings or infrared readings? 
    - If so, would you be able to conclude that the evidence is legitimate just by observing these readings? Or do you lack an understanding of sonar or infrared signals to identify possible signs of falsified evidence or miscalculations?
    - Is it reasonable to assume that the journalist was even capable of purchasing and operating the equipment required to measure these readings? They more likely got them from a marine biologist with access to such equipment. You must now decide whether to trust this next point in the source chain or investigate further as to whether or not the marine biologist could have miscalculated or falsified the evidence.
  - Though you will never get perfect answers to these questions, you will at least be able to construct the possible pathways through which information travels. You can then identify which pathways would be more susceptible to error and assign separate probabilities of truth to each pathway. If you find evidence that the journalist is a known liar, you can lower the probability of that pathway without even having to assess the professional standards of a marine biologist. If you find evidence that the marine biologist was using sonar equipment that had many reports of defective readings, then you can lower that probability.
  - Understanding the motivations of people behind information sources can also help your evaluation. Does this person have anything at stake for spreading bad information? Will they be fired or subjected to public scrutiny? Have they personally invested in their own news organization or journalistic brand? Are there any likely and conceivable reasons that this person should tell the truth?
4. How much Diligence is Due?
  - Gathering, organizing, and verifying evidence is time-consuming, we must understand this
  - There is no objective standard for how much evidence is "enough"
  - There are blurry lines drawn around malicious lying, irresponsible negligence, accidental ignorance, acceptable standards, and omitted margins of error.



### Using the Scientific Cycle to verify information served by links
-- Measuring how frequently you perform the cycle and how much time you spend on each cycle

- Innovations AND new problems, both simultaneously considered
- Understanding that there is a person behind everything, including bots and algorithms

## Virtual Retreat & New Members

- Recap minutes
- Recap raffle system & show prize winner proof
- Next up: 3rd sunday of every month

I'd say the highlight for this month was definitely our first virtual retreat! As a part-time, remote team, exploring ways to increase team engagement and establish a work commitment is definitely a challenge worth prioritizing.

Dave made sure to take some solid minutes which you can check out here: [Minutes 2019-04-21](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ywya05DBEBtQbJaaQvN26eKXjfvSfub91tPi4lDMGSs/edit?usp=sharing). We'll also make sure to get some screenshots next time which could probably make for some richer content (like the Remo virtual office, for example) if we wanted to write an article of how we do things.

I won't recap the retreat too deeply since that's what the minutes are for, but here are a few key things I want to make sure are clearly laid out:

- Retreats will be every 3rd Sunday of the month
- I'll post a preliminary retreat agenda in each newsletter (see below)
- End of retreat raffles with $50 prize(s), 1 point = 1 entry, earn points by:

| Activity | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Attending the retreat | 1 point |
| Attending the retreat as an Officer | 1 point |
| Demo your work in a 5+ minutes presentation | 1 point per presentation |
| Win games played during the retreat | 1 point |

- Officers are given a $50 monthly stipend for education/productivity (premium services, online courses, etc) to carry out their duties.
- Depending on the level of commitment, Officers may also be granted reimbursement for a monthly membership to the coworking space of their choice ($500 maximum)
- Directors are granted a vote on official company decisions and should focus on making sure they align with our goals, while Officers are responsible for actually executing on the work needed to achieve those goals
- Not all Officers are Directors and not all Directors must be Officers
- Contributors can be anyone interested in exploring more about SetLife, delivering contracted work, or possibly taking on more responsibility with an Officer position

## Curriculum Development & Progress

The most significant development with the curriculum involves the realization that video content is a critical missing piece to our technology education efforts. While I did make some progress with the Discovering & Verifying Digital Information course, it felt like I was writing a transcript to what should have been a video and I was taking the wrong approach to the written content. I've decided to shift the strategy for creating the written/text materials towards outlining, summarizing, & linking to external resources, which aligns with breaking down the course contents into something like this layout for the syllabus I've been working on:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4914611/57020780-b6094d80-6c2a-11e9-8fe5-81d1b9b3d7eb.png" style="width: 100%"/>

Additionally, I will be focusing on creating & editing video content myself that revolve around the workshops listed above since videos like that should really come standard with the courses.

Regarding the 2 proposals we reviewed at the last retreat, the design/branding work by branding.studio has been coming along nicely and Marin will actually demo his work at the next retreat. The other proposal regarding the marketing strategy needs some more development and I will be bouncing something back to Brice to help get more definition on that engagement and make sure it's worth the investment.

## Open Source Development

On the conversation of rebranding "software tooling" to something more commonly understood, I think "development tools" is a bit simpler, and can fall more broadly under the "open-source development" umbrella that includes contributing to other interesting software projects.

One of those projects (create-react-app) is actually exactly the kind of tool we are going for and in the spirit of open-source there's no need to rebuild something that already works well. I took some time this month to set up the `single-page-app` package for our [development-tools project](https://github.com/setlife-network/development-tools) with a simple initial set up powered by create-react-app so that we can then build some more educational layers on top. Check out the README here in the [pull request I have open](https://github.com/setlife-network/development-tools/pull/11/files) that explains the approach here with this tool. I'll demo this tool at the next retreat as well to help everyone understand what we're trying to do here with these development tools if it's still unclear.

The other thing I did for our open-source projects is to move Setblocks forward a bit to set up some project-based learning tasks as well as practice my own design skills. You can check out a [Figma prototype I made](https://www.figma.com/proto/H0QMnFBjDSbI7nOXpKhqOHz0/SetBlocks?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=scale-down&redirected=1) to explore some new ideas for the next features/UI improvements we can add to Setblocks.

I also did some work on enabling a payment processing module with Stripe that could be applied to any of our projects like those 1on1 private sessions for the courses or anything else we may decide to monetize on in the future.

## Administrative

Finally I have some administrative items here to report on including the filing of a tax extension with the IRS. This gives us another 6 months to file a Form 990-PF which makes sense since we are still waiting on a Letter of Determination confirming the exact structure we have selected for our organization.

I also have requested a quote from a professional accounting service called [Jitasa](https://jitasagroup.com/nonprofit-solutions/nonprofit-bookkeeping-accounting-services) that would help us with bookkeeping as well as the tax form when it does come time to file (for an extra cost of upto $2500). This would be a nice, affordable solution at $300-$350 per month that not only saves me the time doing the accounting work myself but also brings that work up to a professional standard. We are still in the proposal stages with them and can vote on this expense at the next retreat.

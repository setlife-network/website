## Project Trinary

Our work on transparent efficiency metrics now has a name: Project [Trinary](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Trinary_(Earth-616)). This month we've made pretty significant strides towards making this app, which will eventually be the tool we use for an accurate, up-to-date reading of how we're using our time and money to work on projects. This will enable us to clearly and effectively communicate with our clients about what they can expect.

We are establishing and refining our data model, a visualization of what information will flow through this app, when and how.

## Asociación SetLife

Viki is working on paperwork and other steps: She found and met with an accountant that seems to line up with our values ([Facto Cooperativa](https://facto.cat/), a cooperative of accountants/consultants that specialize in working with entities working towards a “[social and solidarity economy](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/economia-social-solidaria/en/what-Social-and-Solidarity-Economy)”), and we now have a price quote of 100 €/month for all our accounting, fiscal and contracting needs. This accountant suggested we hold off on officially declaring the start of our "financial activity" with the Spanish state to avoid certain fiscal obligations, as well as paying for an accountant for kind of no reason.

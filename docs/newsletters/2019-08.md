# Tech Education

We hit a pretty solid milestone this month on development for the tech-education project in deploying the backend API routes Rebeca had finished. They are hosted at `https://tech-education.herokuapp.com` & you can test one of them at `https://tech-education.herokuapp.com/api/fetchCourses`

Our next steps for this project involve building a Content Management System (CMS) in order to update course information, topics, & content directly from a basic interface. Design resources aren't exactly in abundance but I can do my best to screenshot similar sites that we can emulate. We are still in planning the foundation for this but it will definitely include multi-language support so we can have Spanish versions of the content as well.

# Website

As for the website project, we have been doing some thorough polishing and optimizations for mobile and there was several things I overlooked in making sure this was ready for production. Sofia did a great job with the foundation and core development and the last 5% is always the hardest part to ship!

Rebeca also added a backend API route that uses the SendGrid API to send an email to contact@setlife.network whenever users submit their email on the site. With this we can start developing a mailing list of anyone interested in learning more about SetLife.

# Open-Source Development

The last substantial update I have is a new strategic pivot when it comes to open-source development. I spent some time contributing to lnd which is an open-source project developing a permissionless, peer-to-peer payments system that uses cryptgraphic channels to allow people to send money in the world, all without requiring a bank account.

This is quite an exciting project, but it also made me realize how strong & robust existing open-source communities are and I thought a bit about how we can better support software projects like this. When it comes to developing our own projects, they've been great for steady learning & a sense of ownership, but I'm also formulating a strategy to attract more experienced mentors that I can work with to scale our project-based learning programs.

Creating a budget to hire or pay experienced developers to contribute to innovative open-source projects could be interesting if they also agree to guide & mentor less experienced developers through these kinds of learning programs. I'll be continuing to explore the viability of this model in the long-term, but for now I think reframing our messaging from "software tooling/open-source development tools" to simply "open-source development" is simply and easier to build upon in the future.

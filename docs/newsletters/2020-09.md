## Project Trinary

Our app for transparent efficiency metrics is well underway. This month, along with further refining our data model, we've focused on mock-ups and design for all of the ways we want to display this information: client information and the payments they make, how often github issues get opened and closed, payments made to the freelancers we work with and what their rates are, etc.

## Asociación SetLife

We now have everything in place to take the next steps in operating legally as an entity in Spain. However, taking those steps will require us to fulfil certain fiscal obligations (basically filing a bunch of forms every 3 months and other bookkeeping tasks). To avoid spending unnecessary time on this admin work, or money spent on an accountant to do it for us, we have decided to hold off until we have some work lined up in Europe, or some other reason that would prompt us to dive in and start operating fully.

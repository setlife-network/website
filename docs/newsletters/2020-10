# The SetLife Network

## Project Trinary

We are continuing to design mock-ups, refine our data model, and add functionality to our prototype.

## Asociaci√≥n SetLife

We are still on standby until an opportunity to operate in Spain (or Europe) presents itself.

We discussed the possibility of applying for grants and such, which would prompt our taking that step, but at the moment surface-level searches yield financial aid related to covid-19 pandemic issues (for industries and businesses that have been hit hard by this itty bitty virus). Viki expects it will be hard to find local information relevant to us in that sea, should it exist... We will try widening the scope to include all of Europe (beyond just Spain) as well as the [civic sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_sector) (beyond just the public sector of state grants and funding). Viki will get a meeting next month with [Barcelona Activa](https://www.barcelonactiva.cat/barcelonactiva/cat/), a local government office that helps people launch their projects, and ask there if they know of anything that would interest us, or at least where to look out for this kind of stuff.

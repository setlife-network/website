# Project-Based Learning Updates

Between a handful of updates this month on SetLife projects, we are closer than ever to getting the landing page live with a wholesome v1 release. We've wrapped up last-minute touches including tablet responsiveness, GDPR compliance, & a Spanish language toggle while getting the copy & content finalized & ready for translation.

We are in a slow & steady planning & design phase on the tech-education project but there are some backend items in the works that could help us make progress with minimal UI. 

Moreover, Rebeca & Sofia both have resumed their academic class schedule and so I see September as a good month to mark the end of Trial 2 & the beginning of Trial 3 for these project-based learning programs. Since we are experimenting with the structure, it'd be good to stop and document time commitment, key results, & feedback.

We can start to generalize and describe a remote summer program that students may be interested in participating in between semesters. I've outlined some of my key takeaways on where to take it from here:

I definitely like the scheduled weekly sessions and I think making them as productive as possible would not only improve the learning experience, but also allow me to eventually do maybe ~2-4+ of them in a single day, ideally keeping them to < 30-60 mins per session.

I think as a contributor, you would really try to use these sessions to achieve the following:
1. Ask questions about open issues on any SetLife projects to better understand what is required to close the issue
2. Assess whether you think you can make progress on at least 1 issue & figure out what knowledge you think you might be missing
3. Present your approach to any issue you might be working on where you may want to know if there’s a simpler solution

After these sessions, as a mentor I can then go out and find the right resources that will help contributors make progress on the issue (find a Treehouse course, YouTube video, guides/tutorial, etc) and comment them on the issue/send them via Slack for contributors to review before the next session. So as a mentor my priorities on a weekly basis are:

1. Refine issues on any Setlife project by adding detail and clarity to what’s required to close them
2. Open new issues and make sure existing ones are being closed out if they are not needed or have been completed
3. Familiarize myself with online resources that I can recommend as needed

Overall I'm pretty happy with what we've been doing on making project-based learning more tangible for people to be able to experience with structured yet flexible program formats.

Also I'll be learning video animation production in my spare time to try and reboot progress on the curriculum content.

# Bitcoin Workshop

A brief note that I'll be preparing a Bitcoin workshop for the next retreat on November 17th! The goal is to forget the distracting investment/price hype side of Bitcoin & demonstrate why it is a fundamental technology of the future in a way that's hands-on & educational. It's also quite a complicated topic so I'm always looking for more practice on explaining the complex cryptographic bits. 

I'll also touch on how it is maintained as an open-source project, since I think there's a lot we can learn from the rigorous pull request review process going on in the actual source code development.

# Filing Updates & 2020 Operations

Finally, Viki & I have been busy fielding responses from the US & Spanish tax/regulatory bodies to advance both of the filings we have in process:
One for establishing a Spanish association & setting up a European bank account and the other to obtain a tax exemption determination from the IRS which will be critical in setting a budget 2020 operations.

The Spanish filing will be resubmitted since the delays so far seem to have been clerical errors rather than any actual addressable issues with the formation of the company & the substance of its activities.

The IRS filing was a welcome surprise after a nearly 6-month wait. They did not reject us outright and instead requested additional information to make a determination. We just today submitted our responses and since our application seems to be under active review, I doubt it will take much longer. This determination will make quite a different in planning for 2020 since there is a ~$4K - $5k allocation of our cash holdings that is reserved in case our 2018 revenue is subject to income tax. If the IRS grants us an exemption as a charitable, educational & scientific organization, we can put this money towards operations in 2020 & keep things going strong. 

In either case I'm hoping to be able to donate some of my personal income if necessary for additional support, and we will still hold elections in November/December to make sure we have at least 3 directors committed to the organization. 

I will prepare a list of official positions since I have these things scattered in a few different places, but I think it'd be really helpful for everyone to read through the section below which was included in our IRS application. It's great to look back on goals set for the future and see how we've stacked up. A lot of this is still in the works and should help inform the roles & responsibilities we would take on as officers of the organization.

> ## Part IV Narrative Description of Your Activities
> Since 2018 is the first year of operations for The SetLife Network (“SetLife”), past and present activities will be categorized together as an annual statement.> 
>
> ### Past and Present Activities (2018-present)
> #### Planning, research, and administration of nonprofit operations
> * SetLife’s planned activities were first made public at the beginning of 2018 in the form of a private GitHub repository created by Oscar Lafarga. A public-facing set of documentation was launched using GitHub Pages and made available online. This included the [mission statement](https://setlife.network/) (https://setlife.network/) of the organization and a public link to an open-source software toolset used as a boilerplate for creating React+Node applications.
> * This activity is conducted continuously and remotely by Oscar Lafarga throughout the United States and Europe, primarily in Fort Lauderdale, FL, and Barcelona, Spain. As founding directors, David Lafarga and Veronica Lafarga provided input during planning discussions.
> * SetLife’s exempt purposes are fundamentally unachieveable without proper planning, thorough research, and general administration. An educational program cannot be delivered without an audience to receive it and an organization cannot grow without a documented and public mission that attracts interested individuals and organizations.
> * See Part V for details on funding and compensation.
> #### Research and development of the core curriculum for technology education
> * Over the course of the year, a [curriculum ethos and preliminary outline](https://setlife.network/Curriculum-Outline) (https://setlife.network/Curriculum-Outline) of planned course material was published and developed as part of the technology education arm of the organization. The first course was published as a version 1.0 in November 2018 to teach the fundamentals of software engineering. The other three courses were developed further and iterated upon to varying degrees.
> * This activity is conducted continuously and remotely by Oscar Lafarga and David Lafarga throughout the United States and Europe, primarily in Fort Lauderdale, FL, and Barcelona, Spain.
> * Educational programs must be based on thorough research and qualified expertise to ensure the quality of the information within course material. Continued iteration and incorporation of feedback improves the transmission of the information so that the material is comprehensible and intellectually valuable within an educational context.
> * See Part V for details on funding and compensation.
> #### Engineering and consulting services with specialized software tooling
> * In February 2018, SetLife engaged in a consulting contract with the Blockchain Education Network (“BEN”) to redesign their website and explore mutually beneficial technology solutions. As a technical advisor to BEN, Oscar Lafarga participated as a mentor and judge at the MIT Bitcoin Expo and Hackathon, helping young hackers with technical guidance during the competition.
> * In May 2018, SetLife engaged in a consulting contract to provide engineering and development services to a Florida startup seeking to bring global financial services to underbanked populations.
> * The exact frequency of this activity varies on a per-project basis, but currently Oscar Lafarga and Quinn Pruitt provide services remotely as well as on-site in Tampa, FL.
> * These services are a direct application of SetLife’s software tooling activities and also have a significant impact on the development of technology education material. Clients are often technically unfamiliar with product/software development processes and the insights gained through this kind of communication and documentation are instrumental in effectively articulating certain pieces of knowledge in curriculum materials.
> * This activity is funded by the client requesting services and considers travel costs, meals and incidentals, and accomodations for on-site work.
> * See Part V for details on funding and compensation.
> #### Development and testing of software tools
> * The SetLife boilerplate is built with many different open-source libraries that are constantly updated and improved as IT industry standards evolve. Ongoing maintenance is recommended in order to attract developers with a simplified and secure experience and involves integrating and testing new and existing software dependencies.
> * This activity is infrequent depending on the nature of each feature and is primarily conducted by Quinn Pruitt remotely throughout the United States.
> * See Part V for details on funding.
> #### Organization and management of the first project-based learning program
> * The revenue generated from consulting services was used to organize the [first project-based learning program](https://setlife.network/Project-Based-Learning-1-Barcelona) (https://setlife.network/Project-Based-Learning-1-Barcelona) in Barcelona, Spain.
> * This program is the first effort at creating an experience that is highly-conducive to learning, rich with cross-cultural dynamics, and rooted in technologyThis program is the first effort at creating an experience that is highly-conducive to learning, rich with cross-cultural dynamics, and rooted in technology.
> * This activity was primarily conducted by Oscar Lafarga, but Quinn Pruitt, David Lafarga, and Victoria Lafarga were all core contributors to the project objectives.
> * See Part V for details on funding.
> #### Establishing a Spanish corporate entity
> * SetLife is currently in the process of establishing international operations by forming a Spanish association, which is the regulatory analogue of a nonprofit organization in the US.
> * This activity is primarily being conducted by Victoria Lafarga, with input from Oscar Lafarga.
> * See Part V for details on funding.
> #### Translation of educational material and corporate documents
> * The Fundamentals of Software v1.0 course was translated to Spanish to improve accessibility for non-English speakers.
> * Much of the same information contained in this Form 1023 is being translated to Spanish for regulatory filings.
> * This activity involves creating, editing, and proofreading company documents to ensure technical clarity and linguistic quality.
> * This activity is conducted by Victoria Lafarga.
> * See Part V for details on funding.> 
>
> ### Planned activities (2019 and beyond)
> #### Continued project-based learning programs
> * SetLife will organize at least one or two more project-based learning programs in 2019, iterating on the structure and operations of the first trial. An application process will be formalized to select future contributors and SetLife will assist in the logistics of travel, accomodations, and immigration requirements. The president and director of learning and development will be conducting these activities and the director of international operations will assist with Spanish-based logistical issues.
> #### Curriculum development and deployment
> * The curriculum will continue to be developed with additional text and video material. Deployment of the curriculum will expand to physical classrooms in both the U.S. and Spain throughout 2019, and Latin America in 2020. Virtual classrooms will also be deployed at the expense of a less intimiate experience with more widespread reach. Tutoring services will be considered as a source of revenue, but the core material will be always be free and open-source. The president and director of Learning and Development will be conducting these activities.
> #### Advanced software tooling
> * The SetLife software toolkit will be maintained to keep up with industry standards and integrate convenience and educational features so that the experience of developing applications is as productive and pleasant as possible. The director of Technology will be conducting these activities.
> #### Governance engineering
> * SetLife will roll out a functional and transparent digital system for its governance and operations. This includes tools for directors to generate regulatory filings and financial documents as well as a [platform for collaborative project development](https://setlife.network/SetBounty-v1-Spec) (https://setlife.network/SetBounty-v1-Spec). The president and director of Technology will be conducting these activities.

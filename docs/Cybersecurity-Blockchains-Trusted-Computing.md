## Course Outline

### 1. Introduction to Computer Security

## "Technology"
I'd like to start this section by laying down some groundwork and perspective on what people consider "technology". When we're talking about security there will necessarily be an element of fear that may distract people from the more important context of understanding how we use technology. Before we get into it, defining what technolog

Technology is not 

#### a. Explain computing, networking, and storage. 
#### b. Identify the risks of computer use and how to defend them
#### c. OSI Model, Provide lots of analogies to elaborate on abstractions
### 2. Basic and Familiar Security Practices
#### a. Passwords and encryption
#### b. Data access and integrity
#### c. Security Theory, who stands to gain?
#### d. Brute-force attacks, captchas
### 2. What is a blockchain?
#### a. Data stored and relayed by many computers
#### b. Public, transparent, and resistant to changes
#### c. Public-private key cryptography
### 3. Who do you trust?
#### a. It's okay to trust, just know who you are trusting
#### b. Chip manufacturers for low-level hardware, Apple for hardware-software interface, software developers for running programs
#### c. Know how online services use your data
### 4. Cybersecurity at the Macro Level
#### a. Consider social factors as much as technical ones, why would someone attack you? Are you more likely to be attacked through one vector versus another (don't get too paranoid)
#### b. Extrapolate vulnerabilities to major infrastructure

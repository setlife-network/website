Survey Responses

Organization & Operations
+ We used Slack to communicate well
+ Weekly syncs were flexible
+ GitHub Issues

- Adding slack app (Kyber) to improve
- Better content/marketing efforts

PBL2
- Barcelona again? Other locations?
- Work schedule adjustments?
- More group activities (workshops, field trips, etc)
- Daily standups? Every other day?
- 6 max? Ratio of students to mentors?
- Housing logistics
- Application process... what kind of candidates? Consider housing preferences in the selection process
- Teachers who want to learn project management skills
- Students who want to learn skills but become teachers in the process

Governance
- Play-by-play of retroactive motions
1. Founding board is Oscar, David, & Veronica
2. Quinn is added by majority vote (Oscar + David)
3. Veronica resigns
4. Victoria is added by unanimous vote (Oscar + David + Quinn)
5. Current board stands

- Monthly director's meetings (quarterly/bimonthly + on-demand?)
- Majority rules.. an even number of directors grants President veto... aka 2 directors need President's vote, but 3 directors without the President can overrule
- Directors serve 3-6 month terms
- President serves a 1 year term, elected in December
- Submit a nomination, nominee accepts, nominator schedules a meeting to discuss, motion to vote, seconded and elect

Financial Report - $37K secured ($10K invoiced)
- Quinn: 10-20 weekly hours @ $75/hr + $250 per weekly report for 18 more weeks

Harbor Space Lead (11/22)
Course Feedback

- Question: Each course in a 3-week module or the entire curriculum as a 3 week module?
- FS, IGR, and CBTC in a 3-week module (1 week for each) would be best suited for the MSL foundational course
- PPD could be a standalone course and should include project-based learning
- Package course material in newsletter

Next Steps

- Talk to Academic Head and upon approval an interview with Founder will be scheduled
- Course schedule is nearly full for 2018-2019 academic year so expected schedule would likely be Q4 2019
- Process would be to fill syllabus and provide content for course listing on Harbor Space including a 15 session breakdown of course material
- 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, 3 weeks

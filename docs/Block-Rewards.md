| Issue-Hour (SetBlock)             | $60 |
| Weekly Closed Issues              | $0+ | (funded by issue creator) |
| Monthly Collaborated Issues       | $1000 | Issues opened by you, closed by someone else
| Quarterly Profit Distribution     | 25% of all revenue |

## Examples

1. Bob is used to 8-hour work days Monday through Friday. Working an __issue-hour__, or focusing for 1-4 hours on an open issue, 2x a day, 5 days a week would total **$600** by the end of the __week__. He managed to close 10 issues in total for a single project that is currently under-budget. He earns any bounties assigned to these issues, which happened to total another **$250**, bringing his weekly total to **$850**.

2. Alice secures the 1st $20,000 payment of a 2-month contract after 4 weeks of communicating with the client and engineering the sales proposal. **25%** of this revenue is allocated towards quarterly operating profits. Another **25%** is rewarded to Alice as a commission, which she shares with Charlie for contributing some graphic designs and visual aides to the final proposal. The remaining **50%** is staked towards continued production of the project deliverables. With a $10,000 budget, she allocates a fixed number of $60 Setblocks for each of the 8 weeks and chooses 1 Developer for every 8 Setblocks in that week. She estimates 4 Setblocks for herself every single week, 8 SetBlocks for Dave for the first 4 weeks, and then 4 _more_ Setblocks for Charlie in the last 4 weeks for polish and quality assurance.

Alice:      $240 x 8 weeks =    $1920
Dave:       $480 x 8 weeks =    $3840
Charlie:    $240 x 4 weeks =    $960

Budget Remaining:               $3280

With this resource allocation, Alice must spend $405 each week on issues to activate them (minimum $5 per issue). Dave and Charlie will only earn their SetBlock rewards if they are tracking time on a funded issue they are assigned to and that issue has been closed by Alice.

Imagine Alice was confident enough in the 4 issues assigned to her own SetBlocks for a given week, that she didn't need to incentivize herself to make sure they got done. She leaves the minimum $5 funding on her issues and distributes the remaining $385 to Dave's 8 issues (~$48 each). Dave has the opportunity to earn an additional $385 by the end of the week by closing as many issues as possible. Dave's worst case scenario is working all week, failing to close even 1 issue and earning $0. As soon as an issue is closed, payment for all SetBlocks worked will be disbursed, so if it takes Dave 10 Setblocks to finish his 1st issue, he will receive (10 x $60) + $48 = $648 as soon as the issue has been closed. While this is presented as failure scenario in this example, an issue may evolve in complexity over a given week. It may be perfectly justified for an issue to require substantial iteration and Alice would add more funds to the reward to reflect that. However, development operations should prefer closing the issue in its current form and creating a new related issue to be funded separately so that funds can be disbursed for hours worked.
